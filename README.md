# Catch@Me UI
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dane-johnson/catchme-ui.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dane-johnson/catchme-ui) [![Heroku](http://heroku-badge.herokuapp.com/?app=angularjs-crypto&style=flat&svg=1)](https://catchme-ui.herokuapp.com/)

This is the user-end application for my new project, Catch@me.

This project currently utilizes React, Webpack, and Babel to present the application in a single page.

The UI will eventually be served statically and will then interface with a websocket server during play.
